\n\nFor the Pizza Dough:
\n• 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
\n• 1 teaspoon sugar
\n• 1 cup warm water (about 110°F or 43°C)
\n• 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
\n• 1 teaspoon salt
\n• 2 tablespoons olive oil
\n\nFor the Pizza Toppings:
\n\n 1 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)
\n• 2-3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
\n• Your favorite pizza toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, olives, onions, etc.)
\n• Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)
\n\nProcedure:
\n\nFor the Pizza Dough:
\n1. In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy, indicating that the yeast is active.
\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix to form a dough.
\n3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Form it into a ball.
\n4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours or until it has doubled in size.
\n\nFor Assembling and Baking the Pizza:
\n\n1. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (usually around 500550°F or 260-290°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.
\n2. Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 5 equal portions (or fewer if you want larger pizzas).
\n3. Roll out each portion of dough on a floured surface into a round or rectangular pizza shape, depending on your preference.
\n4. Place each rolled-out pizza dough on a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
\n5. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce on each pizza, leaving a small border around the edges.
\n6. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
\n7. Add your desired toppings. Be creative and have fun!
\n8. Carefully transfer the pizza (with parchment paper if using a baking sheet) to the preheated oven or pizza stone.
\n9. Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.
\n10. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute. If desired, garnish with fresh basil leaves.
\n11. Slice and serve your homemade pizzas to your family or guests. Enjoy!
Repeat the process for each portion of dough to make individual pizzas for 5 members.
\n\n\nYou can customize each pizza with different toppings to suit everyone's
