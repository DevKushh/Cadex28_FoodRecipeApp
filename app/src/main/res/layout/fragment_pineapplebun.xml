\n\nFor the Dough:
\n\n• 3 cups all-purpose flour
\n• 1/3 cup granulated sugar
\n• 1/2 teaspoon salt
\n• 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
\n• 1/2 cup warm milk
\n• 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
\n• 1 egg
\n\nFor the Pineapple Topping:
\n\n• 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
\n• 1/2 cup granulated sugar
\n• 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
\n• 1 egg
\n• 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
\n• 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
\n• A few drops of yellow food coloring (optional)
\n\nProcedure:
\n\nFor the Dough:
\n\n1. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.
\n3. Add the frothy yeast mixture, softened butter, and egg to the dry ingredients.
\n4. Mix everything together to form a sticky dough.
\n5. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If it's too sticky, you can add a little more flour.
\n6. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.
\n\nFor the Pineapple Topping:
\n\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine all the topping ingredients, including flour, sugar, butter, egg, baking powder, vanilla extract, and yellow food coloring (if using). Mix until you have a smooth, thick paste.
\n\nAssembling the Pineapple Buns:
\n\n1. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles.
\n2. Divide the dough into 5 equal portions and shape them into balls.
\n3. Roll each dough ball into a round bun.
\n4. Place the buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
\n5. Divide the pineapple topping into 5 equal portions and flatten each portion into a disc.
\n6. Place a disc of topping on top of each bun, pressing it down gently to adhere.
\n\nBaking the Pineapple Buns:
\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
\n2. Bake the buns in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they turn golden brown and the topping is slightly crispy.
\n3. Remove the buns from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.
\n\n\nEnjoy your homemade Pineapple Buns! They can be served as a sweet treat for breakfast or as a snack.
